# Student management system for teachers around the country

#### This project is not available to visit publicly so I have created this README file to display my work on it!

### The purpose of this project was to re-model and re-design the interface that teachers use to manage students in highschool who are taking occupational health and safety courses.

## Dashboard
### It displays the status of each student's progress and which courses they are enrolled in. The table in this page can be filtered by a classroom, by the keyword search bar or by course name in the top navigation bar.
